# Authentication app for those who want to control more!

How to run:
### Make sure you are in virtual environment.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/2208Abhinav/AuthentiNation.git
$ cd AuthentiNation
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./manage.py migrate
$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
$ ./manage.py runserver
```

Try adding more functionality to the code:
* Add better warning system when wrong data is feeded.
* Add a front-end framework and make it SPA.
* Convert it to an API for better flexibility.
* And add other cool stuff...
